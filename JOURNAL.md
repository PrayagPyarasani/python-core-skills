## Milestone 1: Python Basics Completed 🎯

✔ Completed Python syntax, variables, and input/output  
✔ Practiced conditional statements and loops  
✔ Learned functions, recursion, and lambda expressions  

### What I Practiced
- Basic calculator using user input
- Prime number check using loops
- Fibonacci series generation
- Pattern printing
- Functions for palindrome and factorial
- Recursion logic
- Lambda functions with filter()

### Key Learnings
- Logic building is more important than syntax
- Writing functions makes code reusable and clean
- Recursion requires clear base conditions
- Lambda functions are powerful for short operations

### Challenges Faced
- Initially struggled with loop conditions
- Recursion felt confusing until I traced it step-by-step

### Takeaway
This phase helped me build confidence in writing basic logic independently.  
I now feel comfortable breaking problems into smaller steps and solving them using functions.

### Next Focus
➡ Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries)

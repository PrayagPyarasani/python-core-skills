 🐍 Learning Python in Public

Hi, I'm Prayag 👋  
This repository documents my journey of learning **Python from scratch**, through consistent practice, reflection, and real code.

I created this repo to stay accountable, track my progress, and build a strong foundation in Python while learning in public.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository
- Build a solid understanding of Python fundamentals
- Practice by writing clean, readable code
- Maintain structured notes and learning resources
- Track progress through a learning journal
- Gradually move towards projects and real-world use cases

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized in a topic-wise manner:

- **Basics** – Python syntax, variables, input/output, Conditionals and loops, Functions, recursion, lambda expressions  
- **Data Structures** – Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries  
- **OOP** – Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism  
- **Libraries** – Practice with common Python libraries  
- **Projects** – Mini projects and experiments  
- **Resources** – PDFs, books, and useful learning links

## 📝 Learning Journal
I maintain a `JOURNAL.md` file to record:
- What I learned
- Problems I faced
- Key takeaways
- Progress over time

This helps me reflect and improve consistently.

## 📚 Resources
This repo includes references to:
- Online tutorials
- Documentation
- Practice problem sets
- PDFs and notes (non-pirated / educational use)

All sources are credited wherever applicable.
